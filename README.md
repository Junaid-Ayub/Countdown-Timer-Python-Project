# ⏳ Countdown Timer - Python Script  

A simple **countdown timer** built with Python! Set a time in seconds, and watch the countdown begin. When time runs out, you’ll get a **"Time's up!"** notification.  

## 🕹️ How It Works  
1. The user enters the **desired time in seconds**.  
2. The script starts counting down, updating the timer every second.  
3. When the countdown reaches **zero**, a message **"Time's up!"** is displayed.  
4. If the user enters an invalid input, they are prompted to enter a valid number.  

## 🛠 Features  
✔️ **Real-time countdown** displayed in `MM:SS` format

✔️ **Input validation** to prevent errors
